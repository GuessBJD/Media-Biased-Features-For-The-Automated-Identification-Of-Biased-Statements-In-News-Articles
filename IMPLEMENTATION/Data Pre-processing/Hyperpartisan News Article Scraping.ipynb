“uncle” that Stephen Colbert won’t be inviting to Sunday dinner.\\n“The Late Show” host on Wednesday branded Donald Trump as “America’s racist uncle” after The Washington Post reported on the president’s bigotry out of the public eye.\\n“President Trump has maintained that Black Americans have mainly themselves to blame in their struggle for equality, hindered more by lack of initiative than societal impediments,” Colbert said, quoting a passage in the article.\\n“Why the hell did I do that?” he yelled at aides, a former official said.\\nHe also reportedly muttered that Jews “are only in it for themselves.”Quipped Colbert: “Donald Trump saying you’re only in it for yourself is like Jeffrey Dahmer telling you to be a vegan.”',\n"," '',\n"," 'On the other hand, I got a teeny rush when I remembered this was the last debate and that there may soon be no more President Trump to watch.\\nTrump pivoted to Biden’s 1994 Crime Bill and the many Black folks it condemned to jail, as if he expected any Black person watching to think he actually cares about those issues.\\nThe problem isn’t that Trump incorrectly identified the law as a major contributor to mass incarceration or wrongly cited it as a source of staggering harm to Black families and communities.\\nIt was supposed to elicit a show of empathy with Black parents which Trump couldn’t pretend to muster.\\nInstead, he didn’t even bother trying to speak to Black families like fellow human beings, which would’ve required a level of performative skill beyond Trump’s range.',\n"," 'Bloomberg announced on November 24, 2019 that he was running for president to unseat President Donald Trump.\\nThe former vice president, according to OpenSecrets.org, has spent just over $100 million on his total campaign.\\nIn total, Bloomberg spent $1,221,777,405.26 on his 104-day campaign for 55 pledged delegates.\\nTo put that into perspective, that means Bloomberg spent $11,747,859.66 per day during his campaign and a whopping $22,214,134.64 per delegate.\\nAs The Daily Wire’s Emily Zanotti previously reported, former Bloomberg campaign staffers filed a lawsuit against the former mayor for reneging on that promise.',\n"," 'The Trump campaign’s payments to the Trump Organization for a week-long “donor retreat” at Mar-a -Lago earlier this year look awfully similar to money laundering.\\nWhy didn’t the Trump Organization just report the entire $380,000 in total?\\nDonald Trump was in charge of the Trump Organization and the Trump casinos back in the day when FinCEN asserted the penalties referenced above.\\nAllen Weisselberg, the current CFO of the Trump Organization and one of its trustees, has been with the Trump Organization for over 30 years.\\nDid the Trump Campaign launder campaign contributions into revenue for the Trump Organization and turn the election campaign into just another seamy Trump revenue stream shielded from the prying eyes of responsible government agencies?',\n"," 'Donald Trump, a president whose persistent untruths and obfuscation led to a disastrous pandemic response that has left more than 165,000 people dead in the U.S., was asked if he regrets all the lies he’s told to the American people.\\nDáte asked the president during Thursday’s coronavirus task force briefing if, after 3½ years, “do you regret at all all the lying you’ve done to the American people?\\n“You have done,” said Dáte, who wrote at length about Trump’s “Ministry of Untruth” earlier this year.\\nAccording to a running fact-check database by The Washington Post, Trump has made more than 20,000 false or misleading claims since taking office.\\nAccording to the database, he reached nearly a thousand false claims about coronavirus alone in just a matter of months.',\n"," 'The economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world could lead to 580 million people ― 8% of humanity ― being pushed into poverty and see an increase in global poverty for the first time since 1990.\\n“Just imagine that [experience] times half a billion going on all over the developing world right now,” said Max Lawson, head of inequality policy for the development organization Oxfam International.\\n“That is deeply, deeply concerning.”A health volunteer walks through slums in Nairoba, Kenya, informing residents about the coronavirus pandemic.\\nBilly Mutai/SOPA

actions in Hong Kong: Sens.\\nOn July 1, a new national security law went into effect purportedly banning acts of sedition, subversion, and terrorism.\\nLai was arrested on suspicion of “collusion”

congestion, and expands carbon emissions, according to the results of an October survey by Rasmussen Reports.\\nIn terms of the effect on the overall quality of life in the United States, do you favor continuing this level of immigration-driven population growth, slowing down immigration-driven population growth or having no immigration-driven population growth at all?\\nFor example, the Economic Innovation Group says, “The relationship between population growth and housing demand is clear.\\nAlso; 1-in-4 'liberals' (vs 1-in-7 Consvtvs) favor CEOs hiring low-wage migrants before

countries by the coronavirus outbreak, which began in central Wuhan, China, and has since become a global pandemic.\\nThe call to produce an herbal treatment echoes concerning pronouncements in Chinese Communist Party media that the vast majority of coronavirus patients in the country are using “traditional Chinese medicine” to manage symptoms.\\nAs many as 80 percent of Chinese coronavirus patients in the country are receiving traditional Chinese medical cures to remain stable as the body fights the viral infection and clears the lungs.\\n“I believe the effects of combined use of TCM and Western medicine will become better and better.”Beijing has a vested interest in promoting traditional Chinese medicine, as it rakes in $50 billion a year for Chinese businesses.\\n“Some Chinese
