The continuum has its flaws, as some officers are prone to escalate too quickly and others are reluctant to use a proper amount of force. The continuum of force concept begins with an officer’s presence, followed by physical force, then non-lethal options like Tasers and pepper spray, escalating all the way up to lethal force with a firearm, the two experts said.

"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden raised more than three times as much money for his campaign than President Donald Trump managed in March, a potential sign of voter enthusiasm for the Democratic challenger. Biden ended March with $26.4 million in the bank, an increase from February but well below Trump’s $98.5 million. Earlier this month, Biden became the Democrat’s defacto nominee to take on Trump in the November election after rival Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders dropped out of the contest. Biden’s campaign had struggled with fundraising early in his candidacy but now hopes a unified front in their party will help him raise money. Biden has hosted several online fundraising conferences this month, with the campaign asking individuals attending for contributions up to $5,600.",0,1,0,0
